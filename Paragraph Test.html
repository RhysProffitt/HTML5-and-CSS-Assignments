		<h2>Screaming like a small child; It is indignant and only makes you die scared and ashamed.</h2>
		<p>Screaming is incredibly useful for a human, it allows us to experience life in a highly emotional way. Screaming like a little child only looks and sounds terrible, so not only will you be judging yourself as you are mauled, but so will the bear.</p>
